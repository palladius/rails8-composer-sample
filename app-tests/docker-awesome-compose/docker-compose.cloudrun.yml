# Ingress Container Selection Logic
# Cloud Run requires a single container to be designated as the ingress (entry point) for external traffic.  The ingress container is determined using the following order of precedence:

# Explicit Extension: The service with the extension x-google-cloudrun-ingress-container: true.
# Port 8080: If no extension is found, the first service that publishes port 8080 is chosen.
# Any Published Port: If no service uses port 8080, the first service with any published port is chosen.
# First Service: If no service has a published port, the first service defined in the compose.yaml file is chosen as the ingress, and it will be assigned port 8080.
