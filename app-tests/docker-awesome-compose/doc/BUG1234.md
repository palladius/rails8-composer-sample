# Bug: `gcloud alpha run compose up` fails with "Expected type <class 'str'> for field args, found 3000 (type <class 'int'>)" when using `-p` flag in command.

## Description

When attempting to deploy a multi-container application to Google Cloud Run using `gcloud alpha run compose up` with a `docker-compose.yml` file that specifies a `command` for a service, and that `command` includes the `-p` flag with a port number (e.g., `-p 3000`), the deployment fails with a protobuf parsing error. The error message indicates that an integer value (the port number) is being passed where a string is expected for a field argument.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Have a `docker-compose.cloudrun.yml` file with a service (e.g., `web`) that has a `command` array including `"-p", "3000"`.
2.  Run `gcloud alpha run compose up docker-compose.cloudrun.yml`.

## Expected Behavior

The `gcloud` command should successfully parse the `docker-compose.cloudrun.yml` file and deploy the application to Cloud Run. The port number should be correctly interpreted as a string argument.

## Actual Behavior

The `gcloud` command fails with the error: `ERROR: (gcloud.run.services.replace) Failed to parse value in protobuf [Service]: Service.??: "Expected type <class 'str'> for field args, found 3000 (type <class 'int'>)"`.

## Attempts to Workaround

*   Quoting the port number (e.g., `"-p", "3000"`) in the `command` array.
*   Rewriting the entire `docker-compose.cloudrun.yml` file to ensure correct formatting.
*   Removing the `-p` flag from the `command` and relying on the `PORT` environment variable (this also failed because `PORT` is a reserved environment variable).
