# Plan for Rails 8 Application

1.  **Set up the Rails 8 application skeleton.**
    *   Use Ruby 3.4.5.
    *   Use PostgreSQL as the database.
    *   Use TailwindCSS for the front-end.
    *   This will be done inside the `rails8-app` directory.

2.  **Create the `docker-compose.yml` file.**
    *   This file will manage the Rails app, PostgreSQL database, and Redis.
    *   It will be placed in the root of the `rails8-app` directory.

3.  **Create a `justfile` for common commands.**
    *   This will include commands for building, starting, and stopping the application, as well as running the Rails console.
    *   This will be placed in the root of the project.

4.  **Add sample models and controllers.**
    *   Create a `Blog` model with `title` and `content` fields.
    *   Create a `Comment` model that belongs to a `Blog`.
    *   Enable image uploads for the `Blog` model.

5.  **Document the setup.**
    *   Create a `README.md` file with instructions on how to set up and run the project.
    *   Explain how to access the Rails console.

6.  **Set up the GCP deployment.**
    *   Create a `cloudbuild.yaml` file for deploying to Cloud Run.
    *   This will be placed in the `gcp` directory.
